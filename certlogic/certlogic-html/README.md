# CertLogic HTML

An NPM package with React-based HTML renderer(s) for CertLogic expressions, so those expressions can be displayed in a more human-readable way.


## API

This NPM package exposes the following feature:

* `<CompactExprRendering expr={<CertLogic expression>}>`: a stateless React component that renders a CertLogic expression in a notation that's more compact than the underlying JSON.
  (The resulting DOM is static, so can be statically rendered.)
